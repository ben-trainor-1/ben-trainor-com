                    In the second grade, Ben Trainor began learning the guitar, and while learning classic rock riffs and pentatonic scales, 
                    he started composing his own ideas. Until high school, they only existed in his brain.

                <p>
                    Later on he discovered Garage Band and soon Logic Pro, with which he began to record, mix, and master instrumental music 
                    while experimenting with piano, honing electric tones, arranging strings, and eventually singing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His music has always taken influences from movies, anime, and video games, late romantic and 20th century composers,
                    as well as late 2000s emo anthems, creating a unique sound that has become his solo project Paper Watch.

                <p>
                    Now, he's an accomplished composer, having written for short films and theater productions, and is expanding his 
                    repertoire to video games, combining his software engineering background with interactive composition.

                As an educator and professional theatre practitioner for over thirty years, I recommend Ben Trainor without 
                reservation. His experience, communication skills, collaborative abilities, reliability, and creativity 
                will be immeasurable assets to any institution. [His] compositions added immense depth and 
                professionalism to our project.

                The earthtone soundtrack, complete with vinyl needle-and groove-texture, 
                creates the perfect accompaniment to homicide on a rainy Manhattan night.
                Ben Trainor's original score provides just the right touches for the drama 
                without ever being obtrusive or distracting.
