                As an educator and professional theatre practitioner for over thirty years, I recommend Ben Trainor without 
                reservation. His experience, communication skills, collaborative abilities, reliability, and creativity 
                will be immeasurable assets. [His] compositions added immense depth and 
                professionalism to our project.

                [Ben's] work is professional, he's quick and reliable, he's willing to go the extra mile, 
                and he's personally just a really easy guy to get along with. I highly recommend him for any of your audio needs.

                Ben is a musical WIZARD and it was such a pleasure to work with him! 
                I'd compare it to working with the likes of John Williams if I'd ever worked with John Williams.
                He added a whole new level of intrigue and immersion for our audience.

                The earthtone soundtrack, complete with vinyl needle-and groove-texture, 
                creates the perfect accompaniment...on a rainy Manhattan night.
                Ben Trainor's original score provides just the right touches for the drama 
                without ever being obtrusive or distracting.
